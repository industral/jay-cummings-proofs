# Exercises for Chapter 4

### Exercise 4.1
Prove that the sum of the first $n$ odd natural numbers equals $n^2$ by induction or strong induction

<details>
  <summary>Answer</summary>
<br>

_**Proof.**_ We proceed by induction

<ins>Base case.</ins> $n=1$

$1=1^2$ which is true

<ins>Inductive Hypothesis.</ins>

Assume the statement holds for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$, that is
$1+3+5+...+ (2k-1)=k^2$

<ins>Induction Step.</ins>

We aim to prove that the result holds for $k+1$, that is
$1+3+5+...+ (2k-1) + (2(k+1) - 1)=(k+1)^2$

Substitute our inductive hypothesis, so

$k^2 + (2(k+1) - 1) =(k+1)^2$\
$k^2 + (2k + 2 - 1) =(k+1)^2$\
$k^2 + 2k + 1 =(k+1)^2$

which is true.

<ins>Conclusion.</ins> Therefore, by induction, the sum of the first $n$ odd natural numbers equals $n^2$ for all $n \in \mathbb{N}$. <p align="right">â–‰</p>

### Exercise 4.2
Provide three proofs that if $n \in \mathbb{N}$, then $n^2 - 2$ is even.

(a) Prove it by cases, by considering the "$n$ is even" and "$n$ is odd" cases

(b) Prove it by applying Proposition 4.2 to the sum $1+2+3+...+(n-1)$

(c) Prove it by induction
